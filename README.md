<h style="font-size: 40; font-style: bold;color: darkred ;">USE OF WASTE CERAMIC TILES AS COARSE AGGREGATE IN CONCRETE PRODUCTION</h>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
 <p>Now-a-days need to manage waste has become major issue, hence preventing it from the environmental impact has become a challenge. Million tonnes of waste have been dumped each and every year. There is enormous use of cement, natural aggregates and sand in concrete production. Alternatively, it reduces waste as well as cost. Waste ceramic tiles are preferred when it satisfies the specifications of coarse aggregate approximately or nearly. Waste ceramic tiles are used in various manner, for example it can be used behalf of cement by crushing it into fine powder, further it can also be used as fine aggregate by crushing it into a fine aggregate size, and it is also used as coarse aggregate. In this experimental programme, it is used especially by replacing coarse aggregate. Due to which shortage of this building material may take place, thus waste ceramic tiles can be used with regarding to coarse aggregate. In pervious concrete waste ceramic tiles is being used in small proportion as variation is done and strength is being checked. In this combination of waste ceramic tiles with pervious concrete is done. There is a similar mix for pervious concrete like regular concrete but it has porous system which allow water to pass through it and reach ground. It helps in reaching rain water to ground directly perhaps helps in recharging ground water. It has lesser weight compared to ordinary concrete. Usually in pervious concrete coarse aggregate is required in very large quantity compared to fine aggregate.</p>

	<dd>In this coarse aggregate of angular shape are used. Usually in this project two particular size of coarse aggregate are selected 12.5mm and 20mm used</dd>

	<dd>  Waste broken ceramic tiles are being collected from the demolished building, construction site and areas where the ceramic waste are dumped. These ceramic waste tiles are broken into small pieces with the help of hammer manually. The broken ceramic tiles are sieved and the particular size for replacement of coarse aggregate are selected. </dd><br><br>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>•	To check the compression strength of cube, when coarse aggregate is replaced by waste ceramic tiles.<br>
•	To identify the compression strength for well compaction and light compaction in pervious concrete for 12.5mm and 20mm aggregate.<br>
•	To check the permeability by replacing coarse aggregate by waste ceramic tiles with various percentage for two different size aggregate.<br>

<h4>Compressive strength test</h4>
<p>The cubes of 150mmX150mmX150mm size were casted and tested. The concrete mixes of different proportion for 12.5mm and 20mm coarse aggregate are undergoing compression strength. The compression strength is quite resourceful since most of the desirable characteristic properties of porous concrete are qualitatively related to its compression strength. For present cubical specimen is preferred. The compression test was conducted on cubes at 28 days of curing. The compressive testing machine used for testing the specimen is shown in the figure below. The cubes were tested after removing from water and allowing to surface dry.
  Concrete properties are clearly understood when compression strength test is done. Usually, compression strength relies on number of variables like water-cement ratio, cement material, concrete material quality.<br>
PROCEDURE
	Cube of standard dimension is taken and the concrete prepared is placed in the mould by tamping with the help of tamping rod.<br>
	These cubes are removed from the mould after 24 hours and kept for curing.<br>

	After 28 days curing, theses specimens are examined using compression testing machine. In compression testing machine load is gradually applied on the cube placed until the specimen fail and no further load can be bared. Average of three cubes are taken to determine compression strength of the pervious concrete. </p>
